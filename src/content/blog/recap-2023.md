Happy New Year, everyone! It's still sinking in that another year has come to a close. Reflecting on 2023, it was a year filled with significant milestones and unforgettable experiences.

In June, I proudly graduated from high school, bidding farewell to my student days and concluding 13 years of formal education. The summer that followed was spent in Zurich, Switzerland, where I created cherished memories with wonderful people. A highlight of the season was a memorable trip to Croatia with my classmates, a debate-worthy decision, but one I wouldn't trade for the world, given the fun times we shared.

September marked a pivotal moment as I embarked on my mandatory service with the Austrian Armed Forces. The journey commenced with basic military training, followed by specialized training as a certified paramedic.

Adding to the joy of the year, I became an uncle twice in 2023.

Looking back, 2023 was undeniably a successful chapter, and I wish that 2024 has also some great moments, wonderful people, and exciting opportunities prepared. Cheers!
