I recently completed my final exams in June, and now I find myself with the summer ahead before embarking on a mandatory 6-month service in the Austrian army. Im really excited and a bit anxious of about what lies ahead. Questions such as the toughness of the army, the prospect of meeting new people, and whether I'll be pushed to my limits continually cross my mind.

Come early September, I'll be heading to Klagenfurt for my basic military training. Despite the distance from home, I am determined to adapt to this new environment. It's a journey that promises challenges and growth, and I'm eager to see how I will navigate through it.

The plan is to undergo basic military training first, and following that, I'll receive training as a paramedic. This means returning to school to acquire essential skills like CPR and learning how to respond in emergency situations. Ultimately, my role will be serving as a paramedic in the military ambulance.

I am excited to see what awaits me and I will definitely keep you updated.
