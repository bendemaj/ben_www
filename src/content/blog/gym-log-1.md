## A Healthy Mind in a Healthy Body

In August 2021, I made the decision to prioritize my physical health. Like any sensible person, I opted for a year-long gym membership. Despite the convenience of having a local gym within walking distance, I found myself frequently using my car (comfort over convenience, I suppose ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

The initial gym experience wasn't a big deal, but, as expected, I exhibited typical beginner behavior on the machines. Fortunately, I had a friend with months of workout experience who offered valuable advice for gym newcomers:

- **Start Training with Machines**
- **Adjust the Weight on Each Machine to Allow 10 Reps** (with the last two reps being challenging but not impossible)

With this guidance in mind, I embarked on my journey to improve my health and gain some muscle.

## Status

I stand at 184 cm tall and weigh around 83 kg. While I have some mass to work with, my lack of muscle is evident in my slim upper body and a modest belly with a touch of love handles. In a situation like this, setting clear goals becomes essential.

## Goals

My current goal is to increase my body weight to 90 kg and enhance overall strength. Specifically, I aim to develop a more robust upper body, characterized by broad shoulders and a well-defined chest. The goal is to fill out my shirts and achieve a more fit appearance.

If you find yourself in a similar situation, consider setting goals to guide your fitness journey.

I hope this post serves as motivation for you to start working out. I'll keep you updated on this ongoing process of achieving a great physique.
