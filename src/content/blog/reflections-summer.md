description: I spend the summer as a intern in Switzerland

## Arrival

At the beginning of the summer in 2022, I embarked on my journey to Switzerland for an internship with [@Roche](https://roche.com). Throughout the entire month of July, I served as a Summer Intern. Commencing on July 3rd, I joined the Roche Campus in Kaiseraugst, situated near the city of Basel. During this period, my residence was in Zurich, requiring a daily commute of approximately 2 hours by train from Zurich to Kaiseraugst.

My role was within the Data Center and Network Infrastructure Department, collaborating with an exceptional team on various projects.

## Zurich

Zurich immediately captured my heart. The enchanting architecture, narrow streets, and the incredible lake were simply mesmerizing. Where else in Europe can you find a city with a lake suitable for ice skating in winter and swimming in the summer?

In the end, I aspire to revisit this beautiful city, cherishing the memories created during my internship.
